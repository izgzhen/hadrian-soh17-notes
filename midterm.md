Midterm Summary
===

In the past 10 weeks, I merged [28 PRs](https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Aizgzhen) into the master branch of Hadrian project, counting for approximately 1300 lines of additions and 360 lines of deletions. The two of all three major goals, dynamic way and installation rule, are implemented and tested on major platforms. Another major goal, cross-compilation support, is also investigated in-depth.

Besides the development conducted on the Hadrian project itself, I also submitted [29 issues](https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/issues/created_by/izgzhen), in which 11 ones are closed and 18 ones are still open. At the same time, to organize the priorities and attract more contributors, I set up [a project board on GitHub](https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/projects) as well. Finally, I developed [Hadrian's Wall](https://github.com/izgzhen/hadrians-wall), a night build & track system plus other information for helping with the project's development work.

In summary, many major features are implemented, a lot of bugs are fixed, and the DevOps support is significantly improved. It is more stable and usable than before. Also, in this year's Haskell Implementor's Workshop (HIW 17'), we will give an introductory talk about its status and release more tutorials over the usage of Hadrian as well. We welcome more Haskell hackers in the community to try out the new build system, and even better, to contribute to our project!
